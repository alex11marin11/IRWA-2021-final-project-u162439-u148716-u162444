# README

In this repository you can find our code for the Final Project for the Information Retrieval and Web Analytics subject. In the Jupyter file, it can be found the code necessary for the first 3 parts of the project, and it can be run directly from Jupyter notebook. To correctly run the code the txt containing the data should be saved in a folder named 'inputs'. 

In the folder found at the root, it can be found the code necessary for the web app developed for the 4th part of the project. Inside you can see the README where instructions to execute the app are given.
